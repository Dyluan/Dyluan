# Hi, I'm Dylan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **web developer** who is passionate about computers for more than 10 years. I discovered programming in 2012 and kept learning new technologies since. Some technologies I enjoy working with include **ReactJS**, **Angular**, **Django**.

For the moment, my **work experience** consists of a few months of backend development in a small startup.
