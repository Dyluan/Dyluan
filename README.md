# Hi, I'm Dylan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **web developer** who is passionate about computers for more than 10 years. I discovered programming in 2012 and kept learning new technologies since. Some technologies I enjoy working with include **ReactJS**, **Angular**, **Django**.

My **work experience** includes 2 years of backend development in a small startup.
